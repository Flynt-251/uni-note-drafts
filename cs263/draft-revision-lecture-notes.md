# Revision Lecture Notes

> These will NOT be published to the website. This is for my own reference and to get an idea of how to structure the notes to publish (I don't actually know what we're being tested on)

- Structure similar to last year

  - Added Cryptography and AI content (gross...)

- Structure
  - 25% Multiple select questions
  - 75% Three out of Four longer answer questions
  - All questions are worth 25 marks
- Expect...
  - Understanding
  - Critical thinking
  - Analysis
  - Technical (basic)
  - **Not** specific memorisation, or reproducing technical stuff like labs or SQLi coursework.
- Some basic exam advice...
- Please reveal this year's exam it'd be so funny...
- "Can you see it?" returns
- Okay so there is some memorisation.
- Justifications can be flexible if your answer differs from what people are expecting
- "Unfortunately traffickers could be violent", this took a turn
- Remember reverse image searching is a thing!
- "They are wearing some clothes maybe"

- STRIDE
  - Spoofing
  - Tampering
  - Repudiation
  - Information Disclosure
