# Drafts of revision notes for twofiveone.xyz

This is a repo to store all of the drafts for revision notes which will be published on my personal website, [twofiveone.xyz](https://twofiveone.xyz/resources/). Here you can browse the latest changes to notes I've made, point out errors to fix in the content, or suggest additional content you think might be helpful!

Below is the list of modules that will be written up, in order of priority.

### Complete

- [x] CS260 - Algorithms
- [x] CS241 - Operating Systems and Computer Networks
- [x] CS258 - Database Systems
- [x] CS259 - Formal Languages
- [x] CS261 - Software Engineering
- [x] CS257 - Advanced Computer Architecture

### In the works

- [ ] CS262 - Logic and Verification
- [ ] CS263 - Cyber Security

First year modules will *not* have notes written up, as there are already links to other great resources for these modules, some of which have been written by me. The content of these modules is more general anyway.

## Other stuff you may want to know

### Can I contribute notes?

Of course, in fact that would be greatly appreciated. You'll be credited for any amendments you make to the notes, or if you have your own set of notes, I can include these separately and credit you in them (although it wouldn't hurt to host them on your own site if you have one!).

### Are there/will there be notes for CS2XX?

You're likely referring to a module I haven't taken, so no. Nonetheless I am more than happy to include/link to your own notes so people have an easier time finding them!

### Will there be notes for Year 3/4 Modules?

Probably. Depends on my workload, and on the content itself.

### Why are you doing this?

Well, first off I need to revise for the exams, but also, I like it when I'm able to help out other people. And passing on useful information is one such way I like to do that. But also, I'm a big believer in information and learning being free, and so I hope my notes will be usable by future learners well after I'm gone from university.
