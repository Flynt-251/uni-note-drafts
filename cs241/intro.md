# Notes for CS241 - Operating Systems and Computer Networks

To match the split in content in this module, the content in these notes will be split into a section for Operating Systems, and another for Computer Networks. The level of depth will match that of the material, but some concepts may be simplified or abstracted for the purposes of providing an alternative view, mainly in-line with the below.

To help better reinforce understanding (both for myself and you, the reader), I'm going to make comparisons of certain concepts to operations in a restaurant, and a café for operating systems and networks respectively. These will be referred to as *Restaurant Ouvert Souvent*, and *Café Nightly*.
